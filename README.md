# File Encryption/Decryption Tool

A simple GUI-based Python application to encrypt and decrypt files using a password.

## Features
- Secure encryption using AES (via Fernet)
- Simple tkinter interface
- Password-based key generation

## How to Run
1. Install Python and dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the app:
python main.py

## Note
Encrypted files have `.encrypted` extension.
Decrypted files have `.decrypted` extension.
Use the same password to decrypt what you encrypted.
Do not lose the password â€“ there's no recovery if it's lost.
Works with any file type.

**Test Cases:**
Try encrypting a .txt file
Then decrypt using the correct password
Try decrypting with a wrong password (should raise an error)

      -Enter a password/key.
      -Click Encrypt to encrypt the file.
           ~A new file like example.txt.encrypted will be created.
